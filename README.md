Parking_ImageProcessing

### Description:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive smart parking system using image processing techniques implemented in Python. The system integrates video processing, image analysis, and Arduino control to efficiently manage parking spaces in real-time. With features such as vehicle detection, parking space occupancy analysis, number plate recognition, and a user-friendly web interface, it offers a robust solution for modern parking management needs.

## Features

- **Video Processing:** Utilizes OpenCV library to process live video feed from cameras placed in parking lots.
- **Image Processing:** Implements image processing algorithms to detect and analyze parking spaces, vehicle presence, and occupancy status.
- **Smart Parking System:** Integrates with Arduino for real-time control of hardware components such as LED indicators, barriers, and sensors.
- **Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for monitoring parking status, managing reservations, and generating reports.

## Setup

### Video Processing

```bash
cd Car-Parking-Space-Counter-Detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Number Plate Detection
```bash
cd Number_Plate_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Number_plate_detection.py
```

### Frontend Application
```bash
cd frontend_application
```
### Run the frontend application
python -m http.server

### Usage
Video Processing: Run main.py to process live video feed from cameras and perform initial vehicle detection.
Image Processing: Execute image_processing.py to analyze images captured from cameras and determine parking space occupancy.
Smart Parking System: Start the main application (main.py) to integrate video and image processing with Arduino control for real-time monitoring and management of parking spaces.
